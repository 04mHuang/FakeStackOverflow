# Description of Project
Originally, FakeStackOverflow was an academic project with another collaborator to learn the MERN (Mongodb, Express.js, React, Node.js) tech stack. Built as a replication of the earlier versions of StackOverflow, this is purely for educational purposes. In this repository, I will update and build on the original final product.
